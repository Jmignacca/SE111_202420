            <h2><u>REVIEW</u> of the movie <em>Iron Man</em> (2008)</h2>

            <p><b> Joseph Mignacca</b>, <i>January 31st, 2024</i></p>

            <!--5-7 sentence review-->
            <p>In my opinion <em>Iron Man</em> is one of the best movies Marvel has produced. This foundation setting movie introduces us to one of the main protagonist in all of the Avenger movies. This movie is especially important to the story line because it shows how Tony transitioned from making top of the line military weapons to making the first Iron man suit Mk.1. After creating the suit and escaping Tony returns and refines the suit to combat terrorism and to destroy all of his weapons that his company has been secretsly dealing to terrorists. Little did Tony know that his right hand man was the one dealing these weapons and found and created a much less innovative version of this suit. The "Iron Monger" was a suit that his right hand man wanted to turn into a militerized weapon. In the end these two suits fight to the deal and Tony becomes <em>Iron Man</em></p>
